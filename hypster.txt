Using an existing zip file to create git repository-
go to folder and launch git bash
unzip the folder
rename the project folder if needed(it will not  have .git folder till now)
Git init ïƒŸ this will add a hidden .git folder which manages al git related commands
if you run git init command on a folder then it would reinitialize the .git folder
once you delete this folder , then git commands will not work
